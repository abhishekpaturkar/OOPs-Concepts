# OOPs Repository

Welcome to the OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System) repository. This repository is organized into three main sections to help you understand the fundamentals of OOP, encapsulation, and constructors.

## Basics of OOP

- **Classes**: Blueprints for creating instances.
- **Objects**: Instances of classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods within a unit.
- **Inheritance**: Class inheriting from another class.
- **Polymorphism**: Objects taking multiple forms.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a core principle of OOP that bundles data and methods within a single unit or object. Key benefits include:

- **Data Hiding**: Internal object details are hidden from external access.
- **Controlled Access**: Getter and setter methods provide controlled data access.
- **Flexibility**: Internal implementation can change without affecting external code.
- **Modularity**: Improves code organization by keeping related elements together.
- **Security**: Restricts direct data access, enhancing object state protection.

## Constructor

Constructor is a special member function that initializes an object when it is created.

- **Default Constructor**: A constructor with no parameters.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: A constructor with parameters.
- **Copy Constructor**: A constructor that copies an existing object.
- **Constructor Overloading**: A constructor that can take multiple parameters.
- **Shallow Copy**: A constructor that creates a new object by copying an existing object's data.
- **Deep Copy**: A constructor that creates a new object by copying an existing object's data and also the dynamic memory the object point to.
